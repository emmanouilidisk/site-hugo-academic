I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) advised by Professor Nicolas Loizou and Professor Rene Vidal. 

My research interests lie in the intersection of algorithms for machine learning, optimization and theoretical computer science. Specifically, I am interested in designing efficient algorithms for optimization and machine learning tasks. Lately,  I have been working on min-max optimization!

Before coming to the States, I worked with Professor Dimitris Fotakis and Professor Pavlos Efraimidis on the intersection of theoretical computer science and opinion dynamics. I obtained my joint BSc & MSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Democritus University of Thrace (DUTH).
